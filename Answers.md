1. How much time did you end up spending on this coding test?
   For this code assignment I spent 11 hours coding and before I went coding, I spent a few hours thinking about the problem. One pitfall I found out quite early which I spent 5+ hours was how to get file from http and read the content. Something I have only dealt with while programming in Java. I also underestimated the time I needed for this project, mainly because of the pitfall I encountered.
2. Explain why you chose the code structure you used in your solution.
   I decided to go with OOP in the backend with each method modifying data recieved. No global variables were used in this project in the backend. On the client I used Vue for rapid development. Vue allows me to write HTML, CSS and javascript within the same file compared to other frameworks such as React. If I would've picked React, I would've had to deal with more files such as css file for styling.
3. What would you add to your solution if you had more time?
   Create tests for both backend and test, right now this project have no tests so unknown crashes and errors may accur post development. I would also spend time developing a file type validator in backend. Right now there is only a weak file-validator in the client which the user can bypass by selecting all files option in "select file" dropdown.
   I would also spend more time on styling the website, make it web responsive, modern and more pleasing to look at.
4. What did you think of this recruitment test?
   I quite enjoyed this task, really gave me a great challenge with file-reading, regex, string modification and introduction to Dictionaries in C#. Plus it is nice being given a task which reflect what a fullstack developer actually do in the field.
